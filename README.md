## Challenges
- **Encoding issues**: Questions with HTML entities didn't render as they would in a normal html file. I solved this by requesting the base64 encoding version of the data and ran the Question and Answers' strings through a function to convert the hmtl entities to render as expected in JSX.
- **Organization of received data**: The data received from the API was a lot and tough to use in a quiz game. I solve this by storing only the data I was going to use in state and arranged it differently to make it easy to use for my quiz game.

**Example of original data from API**
```
{
  "response_code":0,
  "results":[
    {
      "category":"Geography",
      "type":"multiple",
      "difficulty":"easy",
      "question":"Which city is the capital of the United States of America?",
      "correct_answer":"Washington D.C",
      "incorrect_answers":["Seattle","Albany","Los Angeles"]
    }
  ]
}
```

**How I reorganized the original data from API to store in my local state**
```
{
  "results":[
    {
      "id": <random id>,
      "category":"Geography",
      "difficulty":"easy",
      "question":"Which city is the capital of the United States of America?",
      "answers":[
        {
          id: <random id>,
          answer:"Washington D.C",
          isSelected:false,
          isCorrect:true,
        },
        {
          id: <random id>,
          answer:"Seattle",
          isSelected:false,
          isCorrect:false,
        },
        {
          id: <random id>,
          answer:"Albany",
          isSelected:false,
          isCorrect:false,
        },
        {
          id: <random id>,
          answer:"Los Angeles",
          isSelected:false,
          isCorrect:false,
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```
